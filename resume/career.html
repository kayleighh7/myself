        <p>Quinn has worked as a hostess in a restaurant and has also owned her own business. The high-paced, stressful environment of the restaurant industry has helped her become a better problem solver. She understands that sometimes problems donâ€™t have a direct solution, requiring quick thinking and creative problem-solving. Owning her own business has given her a deep understanding of the market, teaching her how to analyze it and leverage it to her advantage. She also learned the concepts of supply and demand, as well as how to manage the balance between costs and profit margins.

        <p>She has many hobbies and dreams, but in the long term, she hopes to become a lawyer. While the specific type of law is still unclear, she is currently interested in corporate or family law. During this time, she also aims to write a book. Since she was younger, she has had various dreams for herself, including becoming a fashion designer, author, and baker. While baking remains one of her biggest hobbies and she continues to write as part of her extracurricular activities, the only dream she has fully given up on is fashion design.
