        <p>Kayleigh Quentin-Marie Hernandez Romero-Martinez Salazar Cantoran is a Mexican-American Senior at the High School of Fashion Industries (as of 2025).
            She was initially apart of the class of 2026' but due to NOCTI availability and previous credit acumulation, she is decidedly an early graduate.
        </p>

        <p>Quinn, a nickname given by her peers, is an incredibly determined student who strives for excellence in everything she does.
            One of her strongest positive qualities is empathy. Her empathy helps her understand certain tasks better than others, as putting yourself in the shoes of the next person is important. That ability helps to understand peopleâ€™s limits as well as what can be done to decrease peer workloads. Her empathy strengthens her ability to be a more adaptive, reactive, and an overall reliable teammate.
