You’ll often find her laughing and having fun with her friends, always radiating a sense of joy and energy. As the oldest of four siblings, Quinn naturally assumes the role of the leader in her family, though she often embraces the position of their personal bully or "embarrasser," keeping things lighthearted in the process.

At the moment, she lives as the only child in her household with her mother and stepfather, which has given her a somewhat unique perspective on family dynamics. Despite the changes in her family structure, Quinn’s loyalty to her loved ones remains unwavering, and her upbringing has cultivated a deep sense of responsibility and love for those closest to her.
